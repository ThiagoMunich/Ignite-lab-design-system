## ðŸ’» Project

A design system developed from scratch in figma all the way to react using the storybook so that developers, designers, and other interested parties can consult the components to use in the development of web interfaces. 

This design system was developed at RocketSeat's Ignite Lab event following good development practices, such as responsiveness, componentization, testing, state management, accessibility, etc.

The storybook is hosted at github pages and you can check it out [here](https://thiagomunich.github.io/Ignite-lab-design-system/)
